What is AVU? -

AVU is an AV Engine that focuses on ELF viruses/parasites and memory resident viruses/parasites.
AVU uses heuristic analysis and also includes an ELF binary integrity checker.

AVU scans for viruses that use the following ELF infection methods.

TEXT SEGMENT PADDING INFECTION

[TEXT]
[PARASITE]
[PADDING]
[DATA]
[SECTIONS]

This type of infection increases the padding at the end of the text segment and inserts the parasite in this location.
The infection requires heavy modifications to the ELF headers, and increase in file size by modulo a PAGE_SIZE. 
Careful and precise measures must be taken to rewrite the ELF binary without the infection in order to keep the
executable image, as well as the ELF headers intact. I designed a Linux virus that uses this method of infection
so that I could test the disinfection process, which is successful.

DATA SEGMENT INFECTION

[TEXT]
[DATA]
[PARASITE]
[SECTIONS]

This type of infection inserts the parasite at the end of the data segment, this requires that the data segment 
be extended by the parasite length, and because the .bss section ends the data segment (Which takes no file space)
special care must be taken to leave room for it within memory ([data segment] phdr->p_memsz - phdr->p_filesz). 
This type of infection can either create an extra section to account for the new parasite code, or it cannot. 
My AV scanner is able to remove the infection in either case, whereas the latter is slightly more difficult. 
I used several viruses by a very talented author that I will keep anonymous, to test the disinfection process.

TEXT INFECTION 

[PARASITE]
[TEXT]
[DATA]
[SECTIONS]

Type A.
This type of infection inserts the parasite in front of the text segment, so the text segment is extended backwards. 
In essence, the host is really being attached to the virus, so the virus has full control the entire time,
Virus writers might find this nice because the entry point within the host never needs to be modified.

Type B.
This type of infection inserts the parasite before the text segment, then modifies the header offsets of the segments
and sections that exist after the parasite to account for the parasite code. Like Type A. the entry point need not be patched.

For type A. I used a virus written by an anonymous author and for type B. I wrote my own virus, to test the disinfection
process.
